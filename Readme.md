# Total Internal Reflection at the Surface of a Gain Medium

My MS Thesis work.

This work was completed in 2013. The completed PDF is published in the UToledo library as well as on my website. But the python code I used to make the figures was never published anywhere properly accessible. Thus I am now motivated to publish to github. But I may as well publish the latex code for the actual thesis too. It may be hard to build now and I don't remember my exact toolchain, but at least it will be published.
